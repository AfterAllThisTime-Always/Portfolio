Hello! I'm Rohit Singh, from Varanasi, the oldest city in existence, apparently.

I am a creative, time punctual, dedicated, goal oriented individual with a high-energy level, honed communication skills, strong organizational skills, meticulous attention to detail and avid problem solving skills.

I am pursuing my Bachelors from [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Pune](https://www.iiitp.ac.in/) in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024). My current CGPA is [8.6]() out of 10.

I am a member of [Bit-Legion]() - the Coding Club, [Qriocity]() - the Quizzing Society and [Saaz]() - the Musical Society of IIIT-Pune.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
